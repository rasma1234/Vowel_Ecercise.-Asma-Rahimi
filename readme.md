Write a Python program that sorts a list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple.
The program should take a list of tuples as input from the user,
sort the tuples by the second element using the sort() method with a custom function
print the sorted list of tuples

 tuple_list = [(2, 5), (1, 7), (4, 3), (6, 1), (3, 8)] -->   [(6, 1), (4, 3), (2, 5), (1, 7), (3, 8)]
